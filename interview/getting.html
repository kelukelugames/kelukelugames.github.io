    <h1>Getting interviews</h1>

    Post a resume on LinkedIn. Done, right? 
    I have friends who job hunted this way and they seemed to be doing okay.
    But I think using your network is much better.

    Companies and recuriters will like you more and treat you better if you are a referral.
    <br /><br />
    How did I build my network? From school, 
    football games, alum clubs, Magic the Gathering tournaments, 
    <!--Great for bonding with nerds. Terrible for meeting women. -->
    friends of friends, Meetups for interview prep, etc.
    
    By the way, watching your school get crushed <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?id=323220204"> 62 to 14 </a>in pouring rain is one of the best ways to bond.
    "You are sad and depressed? Me too!" Instant friendship.
    <br /><br />
    My advice is 1) be geniune when establishing relationships and 2) don't be shy asking for referrals. 
    In most cases, they get a sweet cash bonus if you take the job.
    So you are doing them a favor! ;)
