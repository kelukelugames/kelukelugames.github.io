        <h1>Getting interviews</h1>

        Post a resume on LinkedIn. Done, right?
        I have friends who job hunted this way.
        But I think using your network is much better.

        Companies and recuriters will like you more and treat you better if you are a referral.
        <br /><br />
        How did I build my network? From school,
        football games, alum clubs, Magic the Gathering drafts,
        <!--Great for bonding with nerds. Terrible for meeting women. -->
        friends of friends, Meetups for interview prep, etc.

        By the way, watching your school get crushed <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?id=323220204"> 62 to 14 </a>in pouring rain is one of the best ways to bond.
        "You are sad and depressed? Me too!" Instant friendship.
        <br /><br />
        My advice is 1) be genuine when establishing relationships and 2) don't be shy asking for referrals.
        In most cases, they get a sweet cash bonus if you take the job.
