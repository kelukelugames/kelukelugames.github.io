        <h1>Notes from a Dozen Software Interviews</h1>
        <p>
            When I graduated from MIT in 2008, I failed many job interviews.

            I claimed <em>"The people hired over me are not better. They are just good at interviewing."</em>

            My poor attitude kept the number of job offers at zero.

            Eventually I learned that all of my successful classmates had spent time to prepare.

            So I solved a few practice problems and landed a job with Microsoft in Redmond.
        </p>

        Fast forward to the summer of 2014, I passed 9 out of 10 screening interviews (only failed the first one)
        and received a handful of amazing offers within three weeks.

        Linked below is every technical and behavioral question I was asked. along with a collection of tips.

        I hope you can achieve greater success.

        Without my friends I wouldn't have <s>passed</s> gotten any interviews in the first place. In no particular order, I would like to thank:
        Darene, Rajesh, Jeff, Danny, Brian, Megha, Chinese Mark, German Mark,
        Sameer, Alex, Andrew, Marcus, Roger, Rich, Shahaf, Ravi, David, Robert,
        BJ, Davut, Lei, Hung, Joel, Aish, Thomas, Makarand,
        Ravi, Ashok, Mike, Mihir, Vu, Pavan, Zoltan.
        And a big thank you to all recruiters,
        interviewers, and hiring managers for giving me a chance.
        <br /><br />
        Lastly, without my loving girlfriend Anny, I would have given up a long time ago.
