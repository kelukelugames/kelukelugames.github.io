        <h1>Interview Questions</h1>

        There are three types of interviews: <a href="#informational">informationals</a>, <a href="#screen">phone screens</a>, and <a href="#onsite">onsites</a>.
        The informational is the first meeting with a company and it is usually a phone chat with a recruiter.
        A screening is a one hour test, by phone or in person, to assess your technical skills.
        I also had many “informationals” with hiring managers, and 80+% of the time I was asked technical questions.
        Unless their title explicitly says recruiter then you need to expect technical questions.
        <br /><br />
        The onsite is the final stage.
        It’s 3 to 6 interview sessions with individual or pairs of interviewers.
        If things go well then some companies will have you meet with the hiring manager at the end.
        And if things didn't go well then the interview loop might be cut short.
        <br /><br />
        It is best to solve these questions on a white board.
        Read the <a href="prep.html">section on preparing for an interview</a> for more details.
        <br /><br />

        <h2><a id="informational">A. Informational Questions</a></h2>
        Recruiters ask these. They are aimed at determining your skill set, interests, and personality. Can also be asked in the later stages.
        <ol class="list">
            <li>
                <b>Why do you want to work for us?</b>
                <br /><br />
                If you can’t answer this question then you shouldn’t have applied.
                Companies want to hear: “I am looking for a challenge.”,
                “I love your company’s products and want to work on something I’m passionate about.”,
                and “I learned your company culture values x, y, and z. These things are important to me.”
                <br />
                One time I told a .NET shop that I wanted to get away from Microsoft technology and work with open source software.
                Unsurprisingly, I did not get a call back. Don’t be stupid. Don’t lie.
                Research the company and tell the truth.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Why do you want to leave your current company?</b>
                <br /><br />
                This is similar to question 1.
                Be positive. Don't say "I hate my boss" or "They never gave me a raise."
                I told a hiring manager that I didn't like the people who did <em>xyz</em> at my company.
                His response was "I was a xyz there."
                Can you guess if I got an offer afterwards?
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Have you used our product? What do you know about our product?</b>
                <br /><br />
                Also similar to question 1.
                Companies like candidates who do their research ahead of time.
                And it is especially important for companies like Apple and Tableau.
                In fact, being familiar with the product is one of Tableau's founding values.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>How can you improve our product?</b>
                <br /><br />
                I hear this question often from consumer facing websites/apps.
                Answering correctly demonstrates you have done your homework and you can advocate for the end user.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Generic behavioral questions like “tell us a difficult problem you overcame.”</b>

        <h2><a id="screen">B. Phone Screen Questions</a></h2>
        These are more technical, but you can still get culture fit questions.
        If you have the option to do it in person then go to their office.
        Otherwise, get familiar with the webtool ahead of time.
        Majority of companies used <a href="http://code.stypi.com/">http://code.stypi.com/</a>.

        <ol class="list">
            <li>
                <b>What is your biggest achievement? Biggest programming challenge?</b>
                <br /><br />
                They want to hear what you can do.
                If you are a senior engineer, this is your chance to sell yourself.
                Tell them about an ass kicking project you did that saved the company millions of dollars.
                Go deep and go big. And this will often be asked during the onsite too.

                <b>Implement an arraylist. Need constant time for adding and removing elements.</b>
                <br /><br />
                Implementing an arrayList/vector is generic but I couldn’t figure out a good way to fill up the gaps in the array when elements were removed.
                If you figure out a good solution then please share it with us.

                <br /><br />
                Can be solved as generic graph traversal problem. But if you take advanage of the hint then you don't need to remember where you have traveled.

                DFS vs BFS?

                And are probably asked to see how well you can communicate a simple idea.

                Most people solve this using queues, which is O(N) space.
                You can really impress your interviewer if you do it with O(1) space.

                    In the previous problem, notice there are empty spaces in the last column.
                    Change the algorithm to move the empty spaces in the last row. Like this:

                For some reason, I just could not figure out the second part of this problem. Felt so dumb.
                Then again, I was exhausted.
                It was six hours of straight interviews without any breaks--my lunch buddy decided to turn my lunch into an interview.
                Note to companies: please don't do this. Us poor candidates really need our break.

                Again choice of data structure makes or breaks this problem.

                Someone asked this immediately after a challenging system design question.
                I was totally caught off guard and just mumbled.
                Though I am very proud of myself for not blurting out "Hookers and blow."

                This often get asked at the end of an interview.
                Or it's the first question asked when the recruiter calls after an interview.
                Companies do this to gage your interest and excitement level.
                They don't want to give an offer to someone who doesn't want to work for them.
                <br />
                I told my Hulu referral that I rather go to Google (recruiter told him to ask me).
                Then I told my Google interviewers that I want to be at 343 Industries or Redfin.
                Guess how many offers I got from Hulu and Google.

                Not at this stupid company!

                -_- Did you read the previous question? In general, try to say things they want to hear until you have an offer.
