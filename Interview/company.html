    <h1>Dear Interviewer</h1>

    May I humbly suggest a few tips to improve the interview process?

            <b>Lunch! Lunch! Lunch!</b>
            <br /><br />
            Meow meow.

    Please respect my candidacy and don’t fuck up lunch.

    why is lunch important? Break for me. Interviews are a two way street. I’m tired and need to relax. Casual conversation. Best time to learn about company culture.

    how can you fuck up lunch?

    1. by purposely not having lunch.

    2. interviewing me through lunch.

    3. scheduling a lunch hour to start at 11:15, but lunch don’t start till noon. This one is a bit of a stretch but I’m whiny so I’m putting it here.

    4. By skipping it completely. Seriously, I can’t believe you forgot to feed me. I’m still butt hurt about it. I already bring my own water. don’t make me start brining granola bars.
