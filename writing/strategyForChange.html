            I watched Obama’s 

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K4MctEmkmI" target="_blank">
                commencement speech 
            </a>

            at Howard. He said passion is not enough. I need a strategy if I want to change the world.

            Currently I am mentoring some people through a program at work. Mentoring is helpful, and following someone else’s plan is a legitimate plan. But those things do not scale. I need to help more than a handful of people at a time.

            So what is my plan? My plan is to write. I have a unique voice as a 1.5 generation Chinese immigrant. Paired with writing skills and a great editor, I can tell our stories.
