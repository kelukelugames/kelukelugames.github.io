	"Your background is impressive and I would like to connect to learn more about your interests as we are seeking engineers who want to take on and build out various high scalability projects at Hooli.",

The purpose of me reaching out is to determine if you would be interested in confidentially exploring this opportunity with us.",

	"we're always looking for great engineers.",
	"I work at Hooli with Chris C (CYC), and speaks very highly of you. He also mentioned that you've done great programming work (I'm curious about your interest in open source, we're a python shop) and that you could be an awesome fit for what we're doing here! I would love to chat with you about where Counsyl is going, and even show you around if you'd like to take a look at the lab and see what were doing! Here is some information on Hooli as well (please also click the links in my signature!)",
